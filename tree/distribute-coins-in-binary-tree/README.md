# [Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/)

You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.  

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.  

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [3,0,0]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
