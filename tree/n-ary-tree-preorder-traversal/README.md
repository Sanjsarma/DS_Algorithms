# [N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.  

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value
