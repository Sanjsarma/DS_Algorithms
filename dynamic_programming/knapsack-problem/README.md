# Knapsack Problem

You're given an array of arrays where each subarray holds two integer values and represents an item; the first integer is the item's value, and the second integer is the item's weight. You're also given an integer representing the maximum capacity of a knapsack that you have.


Your goal is to fit items in your knapsack without having the sum of their weights exceed the knapsack's capacity, all the while maximizing their combined value. Note that you only have one of each item at your disposal.
